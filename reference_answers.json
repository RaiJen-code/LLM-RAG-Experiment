      "What is the main function of a resistor in an electronic circuit?": "A resistor limits or controls the flow of electrical current in a circuit. It reduces voltage and current according to Ohm's Law.",
      
      "Name three examples of sensors commonly used with Arduino microcontrollers.": "Common Arduino sensors include DHT11 temperature sensor, HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor, and PIR motion sensor.",
      
      "What does LED stand for, and how do you safely connect it to a voltage source?": "LED stands for Light Emitting Diode. Always use a current-limiting resistor in series to prevent excessive current damage.",
      
      "What is the basic difference between Voltage and Current?": "Voltage is electrical pressure (measured in Volts) that pushes electrons. Current is the actual flow of electrons (measured in Amperes).",
      
      "Which microcontroller is more commonly used by beginners, Arduino Uno or ESP32? Give one reason.": "Arduino Uno is more common for beginners because it has simpler programming and extensive community support."

      "Conceptually explain how Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technique can be used to adjust LED brightness or DC motor speed. What is the relationship between duty cycle and the resulting output?": "PWM rapidly switches output ON and OFF. The duty cycle (percentage of ON time) controls average power delivered. Higher duty cycle means brighter LED or faster motor.",
      
      "In the context of serial communication between a microcontroller and a computer, what are the fundamental differences between the UART and I2C protocols in terms of connection topology, number of wires, and speed?": "UART uses point-to-point connection with 2 wires (TX, RX) at speeds up to 115200 baud. I2C uses bus topology with 2 wires (SDA, SCL) supporting multiple devices at 100-400 kHz.",
      
      "A circuit uses a linear regulator LM7805 to step down voltage from 12V to 5V. If the load draws 500mA of current, calculate the approximate power dissipated as heat in the regulator. Why is a switching regulator (like LM2596) more efficient for this case?": "Power dissipated = (12V - 5V) × 0.5A = 3.5W as heat. Switching regulators are more efficient (80-95%) because they use switching instead of linear voltage drop.",
      
      "You want to read an analog voltage from a potentiometer using an Arduino. Describe the process flow from the voltage at the analog pin until it becomes a digital value (ADC), including the concept of resolution (e.g., 10-bit).": "The ADC samples the analog voltage and converts it to a digital value. With 10-bit resolution, it divides 0-5V into 1024 levels, giving values from 0-1023.",
      
      "What is meant by Interrupt in microcontroller programming? Provide a practical example where using an interrupt is more effective than polling when reading input from a button.": "An interrupt temporarily halts program execution to handle urgent tasks. For buttons, interrupts respond immediately to presses without constantly checking, saving CPU cycles."

    "true_false_basic": {
      "Capacitors can store electric charge and are often used to smooth out voltage ripples. True or False?": "True. Capacitors store charge and filter voltage ripples in power supplies.",
      
      "An NPN transistor turns ON when the base voltage is lower than the emitter voltage. True or False?": "False. NPN transistors turn ON when base voltage is higher than emitter by approximately 0.7V.",
      
      "Digital pins on a microcontroller can only output HIGH (5V) or LOW (0V). True or False?": "True. Digital pins operate in binary states, either HIGH or LOW voltage.",
      
      "Ohm's Law states that Current (I) is directly proportional to Voltage (V) and inversely proportional to Resistance (R), formulated as I = V x R. True or False?": "False. The correct formula is I = V / R (current equals voltage divided by resistance).",
      
      "The higher the resistor value connected in series with an LED, the dimmer the LED will glow. True or False?": "True. Higher resistance reduces current flow, resulting in dimmer LED brightness."

    "true_false_advanced": {
      "The ESP32 platform from Espressif not only has WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities but also supports programming with MicroPython and Rust, in addition to the Arduino IDE. True or False?": "True. ESP32 supports Arduino IDE, MicroPython, and Rust programming frameworks.",
      
      "In modern IoT development, the MQTT protocol has completely replaced HTTP for device-to-cloud communication due to its much higher speed. True or False?": "False. Both MQTT and HTTP are used in IoT. MQTT's advantage is lower overhead and efficiency, not necessarily higher speed.",
      
      "To connect external sensors or modules to a microcontroller, breakout boards are often used because they already include the necessary support components, making prototyping easier. True or False?": "True. Breakout boards include pull-up resistors and voltage regulators, simplifying connections.",
      
      "Single Board Computers like the Raspberry Pi typically run a full operating system like Linux, while microcontrollers like Arduino run only one program uploaded directly to their memory. True or False?": "True. Raspberry Pi runs complete operating systems while Arduino executes a single program from flash memory.",
      
      "In the microcontroller world, LoRa wireless communication is very popular for long-range IoT projects because its range can reach several kilometers with low power consumption. True or False?": "True. LoRa achieves ranges of 2-15 kilometers with low power consumption, ideal for long-range IoT."
